# Advanced Job Scheduling in pgAgent

## Overview

This project enhances pgAgent's scheduling capabilities by adding support for complex scheduling patterns, particularly focusing on occurrence-based scheduling (e.g., "2nd Saturday of every month"). The modifications span both the frontend (pgAdmin) and backend (pgAgent) components.

## Key Modifications

### 1. Frontend Changes (pgAdmin)

#### UI Enhancements

- Added new occurrence dropdown field in the schedule creation interface
- Implemented in `pga_schedule.ui.js` and `repeat.ui.js`
- Enhanced form validation and data handling for occurrence-based scheduling

#### Constants and Configuration

- Added new constants in `constants.js`:
  ```javascript
  OCCURRENCE = [
    { label: gettext("1st"), value: "1" },
    { label: gettext("2nd"), value: "2" },
    { label: gettext("3rd"), value: "3" },
    { label: gettext("4th"), value: "4" },
    { label: gettext("last"), value: "5" },
  ];
  ```

### 2. Backend Changes (pgAgent)

#### Database Schema Modifications

- Added new column in `pgagent.pga_schedule` table:
  ```sql
  jscoccurrence bool[5] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{f,f,f,f,f}'
  ```
- Updated triggers and functions to handle occurrence-based scheduling

#### Scheduling Logic

- Enhanced `pga_next_schedule` function to handle occurrence-based scheduling
- Added support for:
  - First occurrence of a weekday in a month
  - Second occurrence of a weekday in a month
  - Third occurrence of a weekday in a month
  - Fourth occurrence of a weekday in a month
  - Last occurrence of a weekday in a month

### 3. Template and Macro Changes

- Updated `pga_schedule.macros` to handle occurrence data in SQL operations
- Modified INSERT and UPDATE macros to include occurrence field
- Enhanced property fetching to include occurrence information

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend Implementation

- Added new form fields in `pga_schedule.ui.js`:
  ```javascript
  {
    id: 'jscoccurrence',
    label: gettext('Occurrence'),
    type: 'select',
    group: gettext('Days'),
    controlProps: {
      allowClear: true,
      multiple: true,
      allowSelectAll: true,
      placeholder: gettext('Select the occurrence...'),
      formatter: BooleanArrayFormatter
    },
    options: OCCURRENCE
  }
  ```

### 2. Backend Implementation

- Enhanced scheduling logic in `pga_next_schedule` function:
  ```sql
  -- Finding current occurrence
  occurrence := 0;
  curr_date := date_trunc('MONTH', nextrun);
  WHILE curr_date <= nextrun LOOP
    IF date_part('DOW', curr_date) = date_part('DOW', nextrun) THEN
      occurrence := occurrence + 1;
    END IF;
    curr_date := curr_date + INTERVAL '1 Day';
  END LOOP;
  ```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Schedule for 2nd Saturday of Every Month

1. In pgAdmin, create a new schedule
2. Select "Saturday" in the Week Days section
3. Select "2nd" in the Occurrence dropdown
4. Configure other parameters as needed

### Creating a Schedule for Last Monday of Every Month

1. In pgAdmin, create a new schedule
2. Select "Monday" in the Week Days section
3. Select "last" in the Occurrence dropdown
4. Configure other parameters as needed

## Testing

To verify the implementation:

1. Create schedules with different occurrence patterns
2. Verify the schedules execute on the correct dates
3. Check the job logs for proper execution
4. Validate the UI displays the correct scheduling information

## Known Limitations

- Occurrence-based scheduling is limited to weekdays within a month
- The "last" occurrence option may not work as expected for months with varying numbers of days

## Future Enhancements

- Support for more complex patterns (e.g., "every other 2nd Saturday")
- Enhanced validation for occurrence-based scheduling
- Improved UI feedback for complex scheduling patterns

## License

This enhancement is released under the PostgreSQL License, consistent with the original pgAgent project.
